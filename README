Canopus framework and flight computer software for CubeBug cubesat
platform (http://1.cubebug.org/)

Here we are publishing the software for the CubeBug cubesat platform.
The version we are releasing here is halfway between CubeBug-1 and CubeBug-2.

It has been refactored after finishing CubeBug-1 and before starting
developing CubeBug-2, and has already a lot of the functionality included
in CubeBug-2.

All the interesting code is inside src/lib/canopus

Canopus is a HAL built from the concept of channels. Higher level code
communicates with devices (simulated or real ones) using channels.

The real flight computer uses Canopus over FreeRTOS in a TI ARM TMS570.
Also the same high level code can be built on posix (linux32 and linux64)
thanks to Canopus and a port of FreeRTOS to posix.
